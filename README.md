# VariableExposureCameraJS
A variable exposure camera written in Javascript

This camera is built to be able to simulate long exposure photography.
The underlying goal is to take many digital pictures (like taking a digital video)
And layering every frame together to blend the colours between frames. 
So far I’ve only been able to get good results with black and white photos, so I’ll have to learn more
About blending RGB colours together without changing their intensity/saturation.
